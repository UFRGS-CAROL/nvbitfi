DOUBLE ----
16k double kernel is
volta_dgemm_128x64_nn

to fault injection the same size that call this kernel is 4K
volta_dgemm_128x64_nn

FLOAT ----
16K float kernel is
volta_sgemm_128x32_sliced1x4_nn

to fault injection the same size that call this kernel is 512
volta_sgemm_128x32_sliced1x4_nn

HALF ----
16K half kernel is
volta_hgemm_128x128_nn

to fault injection the same size kernel call is 1K
volta_hgemm_128x128_nn
